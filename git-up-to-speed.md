---

# git goals

- fast
- simple
- *__decentralized__*
- reliable

# Commit lifecycle

1. check out a branch
- work (edit, save, repeat)
- "stage" what you want to commit
- make a commit

^ when you "stage" your commit, this is when the data blobs are actually written to the repository. Committing just links the blobs into the history.

---

# index

## "this is what I want to commit"

---

# index

data in the index has been added to the repository store, but is not yet incorportated into the commit history

---

# branches

---

# branches
## are movable labels

---

# branches

# branches
